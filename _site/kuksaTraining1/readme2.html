<h2 id="11-need-of-kuksa"><em>1.1 Need of Kuksa:</em></h2>

<p>Because today’s software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.</p>

<h2 id="12-advantage-of-kuksa"><em>1.2 Advantage of Kuksa:</em></h2>

<p>The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.</p>

<h2 id="13-how-do-we-use-kuksa"><em>1.3 How do we use Kuksa</em></h2>

<p>The kuksa ecosystem will provide a comprehensive environment across various frameworks and technologies for <em>the in-vehicle platform</em>, <em>the cloud platform</em>, and <em>an app development IDE</em> - that is, the complete tooling stack for the connected vehicle domain <a href="">see Figure 1 below</a>. Essential to this environment will be the capabilities for collecting, storing, and analysing vehicle data in the cloud as well as the transmission of diverse information such as cloud calculation results (e.g. improved routing), software maintenance updates or even complete new applications. While many IoT solutions exist in the Eclipse IoT ecosystem, Eclipse Kuksa combines the necessary existing technologies and fills the gaps for the specific requirements of the connected embedded real-time nature of the automotive domain.<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/kuksa/about/">see here for more details</a>.</p>

<h2 id="21-getting-started-with-the-app-ide">2.1 Getting Started with the App IDE</h2>

<p>Kuksa IDE is built as a full custom Eclipse Che Assembly. Therefore, it includes all assembly components specified and described in Eclipse Che Assembly are included into Kuksa IDE’s build system. A quick start steps can be found from the link <a href="https://kuksa-che-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="211-requirement-system-configuration">2.1.1 Requirement system configuration</h2>

<p>The neccessary prerequisite to build and deploy Eclipse Che Kuksa are:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>-  A running docker instance on a Linux host system (tested with Ubuntu 18.04).
  
-   Maven
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Additionally, steps for building and running a Eclipse Che Kuksa instance in version 6.x are available <a href="https://kuksa-che-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="212-how-to-setup-the-ide">2.1.2 How to setup the IDE</h2>

<p>To set up Eclipse Che Kuksa, the following steps are necessary. If one wants to build and deploy AGL applications &amp; services within Che:</p>

<h2 id="2121-model-driven-development-of-agl-applications-and-services">2.1.2.1 Model-driven Development of AGL Applications and Services</h2>

<p>The Eclipse Che Kuksa instance simplifies the development of AGL applications and services. AGL features the usage of automotive applications based on HTML5, JavaScript, and C/C++, which run on top of AGL. While applications realize a distinct use case, services offers functionality to all applications. For more information please refer to the <a href="https://docs.automotivelinux.org/docs/apis_services/en/dev/">AGL documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The following sections demonstrate the development of AGL applications/services in a model-driven way based on the tool RAML2AGL (cf. Section <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.ide/tree/master/che-6#raml2agl">Raml2AGL</a> ) as well as the building and deployment of AGL applications/services to a remote device running AGL (cf. Section <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.ide/blob/master/che-6/building-and-deploying">Building &amp; Deploying</a>).</p>

<h2 id="2122-ide">2.1.2.2 IDE</h2>

<p>The IDE provided under Eclipse Kuksa not only support the development of applications for the vehicle component, but also the creation of applications for the cloud. Users should be able to choose between two different workspaces and technology stacks that contain the preconfigured and embedded APIs as well as software libraries of the respective applications to be developed. This allows the car to be equipped with new functions and new services to be deployed in the cloud.</p>

<p>Kuksa offers various APIs for implementing vehicle applications, a project template for cloud services, and wizards for easily providing vehicle applications in the App Store via the IDE. The extensive provision of the various APIs and libraries in the IDE enables accessing existing communication interfaces for the secure data transmission, storage, management, and authentication without having to take separate measurements for processing or interpreting the data.</p>

<p>Kuksa also supports the simplified deployment of new applications for both the cloud and vehicle components. This is provided by a pre-configured Eclipse Che stack, to which only the address of a target platform must be specified. Configuration, building and deployment can be done at the push of a button without further configuration or processing. Depending on the application, different development tools (e.g. Logging, Debugging, Tracing,…) can be included. Of course, syntax highlighting, code completion, and other necessary IDE functions are supported. For instance, the in-vehicle Eclipse Kuksa Che stack for AGL development activities features including Yocto based SDKs in order to support target specific programming shown in the screenshot below. After compiling and building software, specifying a target IP allows also the deployment process.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    Figure 2. Kuksa IDE screenshot.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to make new applications applicable to a greater amount of vehicles, applications need to be centrally checked, managed, and organized with regard to various in-vehicle derivatives and variants in such a way that only vehicle-appropriate applications are accessible. Similar to a Smartphone App Store, it has to be possible to add new functions and applications to their vehicle or perform updates or upgrades. Therefore, standardized interfaces of the in-vehicle and cloud platforms are required and they must offer the most diverse and yet simple infrastructure for vehicle owners. Authentication methods, security concepts, variant management, and suitable data transmission technologies in combination with the publicly accessible ecosystem form mandatory components as well as the difference to existing solutions. <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2018/july/kuksa.php">Click</a> here to read more.</p>

<h2 id="31-getting-started-with-the-in-vehicle-platoform">3.1 Getting started with the In-vehicle platoform</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/kuksa/">Eclipse Kuksa</a> includes an open and secure cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via open in-car and Internet connection and is supported by an integrated open source software development ecosystem. The Eclipse Kuksa project conatins a set of repositories and this repo is one among those that contains in-vehicle platform code and also contains required layers and bindings to build a Kuksa adapted AGL (Automotive Grade Linux) distribution. The in-vehicle platform is primarily designed to work with AGL. However the individual components found in <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.invehicle">this repo</a> could be used on other platforms as well.</p>

<p>Kuksa is a wrapper project around Automotive Grade Linux (AGL). From its side, AGL uses Yocto/Bitbake building system to build an automotive domain specific Linux distribution. Therefore, this projects provides a building system that adds Kuksa’s specific Bitbake layers on top of the original AGL. The scripts in this project help ease the process of building an AGL image by simple using a few commands. This project includes the yocto recipes found in meta-kuksa project.</p>

<h2 id="311-required-system-configuration-hwsw">3.1.1 Required System Configuration (HW/SW)</h2>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<h2 id="setup-the-machine"><em>Setup the machine</em></h2>

<p>Execute</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib build-essential chrpath socat libsdl1.2-dev xterm cpio curl</p>

<p>This will install the necessary packages.</p>

<p>Execute</p>

<p>export AGL_TOP=$HOME/workspace_agl; mkdir -p $AGL_TOP</p>

<p>Execute</p>

<p>mkdir -p ~/bin ; export PATH=~/bin:$PATH ;curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo &gt; ~/bin/repo; chmod a+x ~/bin/repo</p>

<p>This will set up the repo tool. Repo tool is used to download the recipes for AGL image.</p>

<p>Execute</p>

<p>cd $AGL_TOP ;repo init -b flounder -m flounder_6.0.1.xml -u https://gerrit.automotivelinux.org/gerrit/AGL/AGL-repo ;repo sync</p>

<p>This will download the Funky Flounder version of AGL. This version has been tested and is recommended.</p>

<h2 id="start-building">Start Building</h2>

<p>Execute</p>

<p>source meta-agl/scripts/aglsetup.sh -m raspberrypi3 agl-demo agl-netboot agl-appfw-smack ; bitbake agl-demo-platform</p>

<p>This will start the build system and would take about 7 hours to complete if you are running for the first time, so you could take a nap :P. The Yocto/bitbake build system has a caching mechanism and hence from the next time on, this would only take a few minutes.</p>

<h2 id="adding-kuksa-layers">Adding Kuksa layers</h2>

<p>Go to $HOME/workspace_agl/build/conf folder and open bblayers.conf file.</p>

<p>Append the following lines to the end of the file.</p>

<p>BBLAYERS =+ “ \
    ${METADIR}/meta-kuksa \
    ${METADIR}/meta-kuksa/meta-kuksa-bsp \
    ${METADIR}/meta-virtualization \
“</p>

<p>Now copy the meta-kuksa folder (Link : https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.invehicle/agl-kuksa) into the $HOME/workspace_agl directory.</p>

<h2 id="312-set-up-the-platform">3.1.2 Set up the platform</h2>

<p>To get started with In-Vehicle platform: AGL KUKSA Build and Run on Raspberry Pi 3 / Compute Module 3 (Lite) can be found from the link <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.invehicle/tree/master/agl-kuksa">here</a>.</p>

<p>To build for the Raspberry Pi CM3 (Lite) platform, go to $HOME/workspace_agl/build/conf folder and open local.conf file.</p>

<p>Append the following lines to the end of the file.</p>

<p>KERNEL_IMAGETYPE = “zImage”</p>

<h2 id="configure-meta-kuksa-layer">Configure meta-kuksa layer</h2>

<p>The kuksa layer contains recipes for the APIs and Apps contained in Eclipse kuksa Invehicle repo.</p>

<p>The AGL image with meta-kuksa layer adds w3c-visserver-api and elm327-visdatafeeder as systemd services. It will install the datalogger apps in the respective locations /usr/bin/datalogger-<PROTOCOL></PROTOCOL></p>
<h2 id="set-up-wifi">Set up wifi</h2>

<p>— Ignore this step if wifi is not required —</p>

<p>With meta-kuksa layer the wifi connection could be set up while building an Image so that the target device connects to the specified wifi, which make it easier to ssh into the device. The wifi settings could be configured by modifying the meta-kuksa/recipes-devtools/wifi-conf/files/wifi_default.config file. Update the “Name” and the “Passphrase” of the wifi you want the device to connect to. More more secured wifi connection please refer to the link</p>

<h2 id="configure-bluetooth-connection-with-elm-327-bluetooth-adapter">configure Bluetooth connection with ELM 327 bluetooth adapter</h2>

<p>The elm327-datafeeder service connects to an ELM327 Bluetooth adapter to retrieve data from the vehicle. Hence the bluetooth connection with the ELM327 adapter needs to be established before the service starts. The BT connection can be configured by Updating the MAC-Address of the adapter along with its pairing PIN. The MAC-Addr and PIN can be updated in file meta-kuksa/recipes-elm327-visdatafeeder/elm327-visdatafeeder/files/bt_setup.sh</p>

<p>Update the fields</p>

<p><img src="/ImageFile/bt_setup.png" alt="screenshot" /></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Figure 3. schreenshot of bluetooth connection setup.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alt text</p>

<p>Now Execute the below line to build image with Kuksa layers</p>

<p>source meta-agl/scripts/aglsetup.sh -m raspberrypi3 agl-demo agl-netboot agl-appfw-smack ; bitbake agl-demo-platform</p>

<p>This would take a few minutes to execute and at the end of the process the bootable image for RaspberryPi 3 will be found in the below location</p>

<p>$HOME/workspace_agl/build/tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi3</p>

<h2 id="313-connect-the-platform-to-kuksa-portal">3.1.3 Connect the platform to Kuksa portal</h2>

<p>Once the image is ready, burn it onto a SD-card and boot up the image on raspi 3. The w3c-visserver-api requires the vss_rel_1.0.json file to set up the vss tree structure. This file can be copied to the /usr/bin/w3c-visserver folder by using scp command (sample file is available under https://github.com/GENIVI/vehicle_signal_specification or could also be generated using the tools in the repo). Once the file has been copied reboot the raspi 3.</p>

<h2 id="launch-datalogger-apps">Launch Datalogger apps</h2>

<p>The Datalogger apps connect to a remote HONO-Instance and hence the IP-address of the Hono-Instance needs to be updated. The datalogger apps are already installed if you have followed the above steps. Now update the Hono configuration in the file /usr/bin/datalogger-*/start.sh with valid IP-address for the respective adapters ( eg: HTTP and MQTT), Port, Device and password for Hono.</p>

<p>And you could start the datalogger apps by executing ./usr/bin/datalogger-*/start.sh</p>

<p>The apps connect to the w3c-visserver service using a websocket connection and retrieves Signal.OBD.RPM and Signal.OBD.Speed values to send to hono by packing the retrieved data into a json which looks like this {SPEED:xxx} &amp; {RPM:yyy}</p>

<p>The Datalogger example for kuksa-app which connects to the w3c-visserver service via Websocket and talks to the Eclipse Hono MQTT adapter are :- <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.invehicle/tree/master/datalogger-http">DataLogger-HTTP app</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.invehicle/tree/master/datalogger-mqtt">DataLogger-Mqtt</a>.</p>

<p>The APPSTACLE environment is created to provide addon services to the connected vehicles. This provides a complite functionality of the vehicles through deploying the <em>Apps</em> on the in-vehicle platform. Therefore, three layers of components are required to enable this purpose:</p>

<p><strong>Core Layer</strong>: Contains the in-vehicle platform components, such as operating system and application runtime. It, furthermore, allows the vehicle owner to interact with the vehicle, e.g., via smartphone access. In addition, it provides an intrface to the 5G infrastructure similar to the core layer of the cloud back-end.</p>

<p><strong>API / Binding Layer</strong>: consists of relevant APIs and components for internal and external communication.</p>

<p><strong>Application Layer</strong>: It represents the arrangement of all Apps that are running within the in-vehicle platform. Some of the Eclipse base Open source solutions to inreach kuksa components are:</p>

the APPSTACLE platform.</p>

<h2 id="protocols">Protocols</h2>

<p>Automotive protocols are classified by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) into four categories according to the transmission rate and their role in the automotive architecture. Specifically, Class A defines the protocols that are used for convenience systems (e.g. lighting, windows, seatcontrols) and require inexpensive, low-speed communication. Class B defines the protocols supporting instrument cluster or vehicle speed communication and require medium-speed communication. Furthermore, Class C is defined for real-time control ECUs such as the engine, braking and steer-by-wire and require high-speed communication. Finally, telematics systems usually require higher communication speed for multimedia (audio / video) and navigation, and therefore SAE defined the additional Class D communications. All four protocol Class categories are illustrated in <span style="color:lightblue">Table 1</span> along with the protocols that belong to each category and are used for in-vehicle communication in terms of their characteristics.</p>

<p>## Architectural Overview of In-vehicle</p>

<p>Modern automotive embedded systems consist of several subsystems, which are comprised of one
or several Electronic Control Units (ECUs). In turn, the ECUs are made up of a micro-controller
and a set of sensors and actuators. They are able to communicate through the transmission of
electronic or optical signals through a dedicated communication unit. The subsystems that rely on network communication in automotive systems are divided into five main categories: power train, chassis, body, HMI, and telematics (illustrated in <span style="color:lightblue">Figure 3</span>). Each subsystem uses a different protocol to communicate, which is selected based on the architectural requirements and the subsystem functionality. Specifically, the powertrain domain is related to the systems that participate in the longitudinal propulsion of the vehicle,including engine, transmission and all subsidiary components. This domain is supported by a dedicated subsystem called Drive CAN using the Controller Area Network (CAN) for data exchange. The chassis domain refers to the four wheels and their relative position and movement; in this domain the systems are mainly steering and braking. In this subsystem category we find two protocols that are used for high-critical communication, namely CAN and FlexRay, as well as the Local Interconnect Network (LIN) for the lower critical functionalities (e.g. door locking, window raising / lowering). According to the EAST-EEA 1 project definition the body domain includes the entities that do not belong to the vehicle dynamics (i.e., being those that support the car’s user) such as airbags, wipers, lighting, etc. Today’s cars sometimes use two CAN buses (peripheral CAN and body CAN) which interconnect the ECUs of the comfort domain. The telematics domain includes the equipment allowing information exchange between electronic systems and the driver (displays and switches). Such interactions are possible through the infotainment subsystem that is supported by the MOST protocol. Finally additional peripheral systems (e.g.,cameras) allow the in-vehicle system to monitor and extract information from its physical environment through the use of Automotive Ethernet technologies. All the aforementioned systems are able to exchange data through a central gateway (<span style="color:lightblue">Figure 3</span>) that is able to map (through packet encapsulation) or forward messages from one subsystem to another.</p>

<h2 id="ex-vehicle-connectivity-concept">Ex-vehicle connectivity concept:</h2>

<p>The technology evolution in the automotive vehicles contributed to the demands for smarter mobility solutions. These solutions are focused on several types of V2X communication:</p>

<p>• Vehicle-2-Vehicle (V2V)</p>

<p>• Vehicle-2-Infrastructure/Infrastructure-2-Vehicle (V2I,I2V)</p>

<p>• Vehicle-2-Pedestrian (V2P) / Pedestrian-2-Vehicle (P2V)</p>

<p>• Vehicle-2-Network (V2N) / Network-2-Vehicle (N2V), 5) Infrastructure-2-Network (I2N) /
Network-2-Infrastructure (N2I).</p>

<p>These types along with their interactions are demonstrated in <span style="color:lightblue">Figure 6</span>.</p>

<p><img src="/ImageFile/V2XCommunicationType.png" alt="V2XCommunicationType" /></p>

<p><em>Figure 6. V2X communication types</em></p>

<p>The units supporting V2X communication are:</p>

<p>• <em>RoadSide unit (RSU)</em>: It is connected to road sensors (e.g. induction loops, cameras) and
a local control center, such that it performs actions or exchanges critical information other
vehicles or servers about road or traffic management.</p>

<p>• <em>OnBoard unit (OBU)</em>: The on-board unit (OBU) is a radio built-in vehicle device mounted on
each vehicle that transmits vehicle data (i.e. identification and location) to a transponder. The OBU itself is a transponder, that is, a data exchange takes place automatically and only on
request of one of the participating devices. It allows Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I, I2V) communications with other OBUs or RSUs.</p>

<p>• <em>Backend server</em> : It is composed by a PKI, traffic management and roadside unit management
servers, all accessible via the RSU’s or cellular base stations.
In order to facilitate this evolution a couple of solutions were defined that are split into 3 main categories:</p>

<p>• <em>5G radio access technologies</em>: This technology provides wide area, broadband access. The
5G technology is currently in the process of conceptual development and standardization by
the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC). The 5G technology is expected to have
a specific V2X aspect of the 5G technology in a practical scale after 2020. However, in this
document we are leveraging the limited standardization to illustrate conceptually its main scope
and architectural view.</p>

<p>• <em>Pre-5G radio access technologies</em>: Multiple cellular technologies were identified by the ETSI
3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), LoRa Alliance and other organizations, such as
Narrowband IoT , Long Term Evolution for Machines (LTE-M), LoRA are considered. Even though these technologies are already used in V2P/P2V, the main challenge when adopting them in other V2X communication types are reliability and safety, which are currently not addressed in the scope of Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN).</p>

<p>• <em>Non-cellular technologies providing wireless access</em>: IEEE has defined different standards for wireless communication, such as 802.11ac and 802.11p, however only 802.11p is flexible in
terms of throughput and offers higher reliability, even though its maximal throughout is more
limited than 802.11ac (from 3 to 27 Mbps raw data rate). The reason behind this is that
802.11p was designed particularly for for safety-related Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANET),
including the V2V and V2I/I2V concepts. IEEE 802.11p technology is currently fully specified
and already deployed in different locations. The following paragraphs start with a description of the scenarios supported by 802.11p communi-cation and cellular communication. This is followed by a description on both the 802.11p and 5G technologies. In the scope of this section we focus on these two technologies, because, to the best of our knowledge, they are considered as the leading candidates for V2X communication.</p>

<h2 id="automotive-api-concept">Automotive API concept:</h2>

<p>The Application Programming Interface (API) for vehicles are introduced and discussed in here. The automotive API’s try to achieve (a) merging the potentially very complex device and network structure of a car into a single virtual device and (b) hiding the differences between manufacturers, models and makes behind a common interface. On the other hand these interfaces strongly differ in their scope (data-subset or use-case), technological approach and creators.</p>

<h3 id="autosar">AUTOSAR</h3>

<p>AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture (AUTOSAR) is a cooperation between car manufacturers,
OEMs and tool manufacturers and defines a software development paradigm for Electronic Control
Units (ECUs) in the automotive domain. In order to separate the development process of application software from the chosen ECU hardware platform, AUTOSAR is introducing a layer model with the three layers Application Software, Runtime Environment and Basic Software (illustrated IN <span style="color:lightblue">Figure 5</span>).</p>

<p><img src="/ImageFile/AutosarLayerModel.png" alt="Autosar Layer Models" /></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Figure 7. Autosar Layers
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The top layer is formed by the application software. It is divided into software components, each of which realizes a part of the application and can consume and provide data via so-called ports. Any communication that does not take place via port connections is forbidden. A port is classified via a port interface (here referred to as interface). Two ports can only be connected to each other if both ports use compatible interfaces.
Two important communication paradigms, that are selected by interfaces, are client-server and
sender-receiver communication. For client-server communication, a server component provides
functions (C, C++) which can be called by clients. A 1:n communication is also possible (i. e. a
server can provide its functionality to several clients). In sender-receiver communication, a sender provides data that can be consumed by receiver components. Both 1:n and m:1 communication is possible here (i.e. a date can be consumed by several components or several senders provide a date for one receiver concurrently). Many-to-many communication is not provided.</p>

<p>The lower layer consists of the basic software and contains the hardware drivers, the operating
system and the communication stack. The communication stack handles communication from and
to other ECUs that are connected via network interfaces like CAN, LIN, Flexray, automotive Ethernet, etc.</p>

<p>All communication, whether between software components on the upper level or between software
components and basic software on the lower level, is realized via the runtime environment (RTE),
which forms the middle layer. The RTE specification document defines a schema for API functions (C, C++), which are usually generated by code generators of the AUTOSAR modeling tools according to the modeled communication between software components and basic software. All communication must take place via the (generated) API functions. Other communication is not permitted. Likewise, all communication interfaces must be defined at the time of development, which makes it impossible to dynamically extend the software architecture at runtime. <img src=".Appstacle_deliverable_1.1.pdf" alt="For detail information" /></p>

<h2 id="34-overview-of-the-kuksa-in-vehicle-api">3.4 Overview of the Kuksa In-Vehicle API</h2>

<p>The Kuksa In-Vehicle API implementation is based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/CR-vehicle-information-service-20180213/">W3C Vehicle Information Service Specification</a>.</p>

<p>The implementation provides all the major funtionality defined in the above specification and also uses JWT Token for permissions handling with decent amount of uni-tests covering all the basic funtions. This project uses components from other open source projects namely</p>

<p>The overall details on how to build and run W3C as well as details of W3C VIS Server Implementation can be found from the repo <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.invehicle/tree/master/w3c-visserver-api">link here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="41-getting-started-with-the-cloud-platform">4.1 Getting started with the cloud platform</h2>

<p>This repo <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.cloud/tree/master/deployment">link</a> contains script directory and it’s subdirectories help to setup and deployment of the Kuksa cloud. These scripts assume a running Kubernetes cluster which can be configured using kubectl. More information regarding the parameters of the scripts can be found within the respective script file of the <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.cloud/tree/master/deployment">link</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
</blockquote>

<p>The deployment scripts are divided into the following parts:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Azure for Azure-specific configuration that provides the basis of Kubernetes.
2. Eclipse hawkBit enables the deployment of the corresponding software update components, in particular the update server. Note that this step requires the installation of the command line tool kompose. Installation instructions can be found at http://kompose.io/
3. Eclipse Hono enables the deployment of a messaging infrastructure.
4. Kubernetes provides functions for the Kubernetes deployment of the Kuksa cloud.
5. Utils scripts that are included by other parts of the deployment infrastructure (e.g. handling static IP-addresses for the services). It is possible to set static IP-addresses and DNS entries for deployed services. For more details on that configuration see the Readme.md file in the utils directory.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="-411-required-system-configuration-"><span style="color:red"> <em>4.1.1 Required System Configuration</em> </span></h2>

<p>To get started, the requied infrastructures are:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Java 8
Maven
Spring-Boot and other dependencies(data-jpa, feign client,pagination)
Vaadin
Swagger (for Rest API documentation)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Just run AppStoreApplication.java class.Spring boot has an embedded Tomcat instance. Spring boot uses <em>Tomcat7</em> by default, if you change Tomcat version, you have to define these configuration in <em>pom.xml</em>. But you have a few options to have embedded web server deployment instead of Tomcat like Jetty(HTTP (Web) server and Java Servlet container) or Java EE Application Server. You have to configure these replacements from default to new ones in <em>pom.xml</em>. 
For detail information, follow the <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.cloud/tree/master/kuksa-appstore">link</a>.</p>
